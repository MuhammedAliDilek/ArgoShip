      This flagship was contructed in 1200 b.c. Argo was constructed by the
      shipwright Argus, and its crew were specially protected by the goddess
      Hera. ... According to a variety of sources of the legend, Argo was said
      to have been planned or constructed with the help of Athena. According to
